From class we create objects.
if we define variables inside the __init__ method they are called Object variables.
class variables are created outside of the __init ..just under teh class variables.
we call variables as attributes. so we have class attributes/variables as well as Object attributes/variables.

Methods are functions defined in the class. 
usually when instantiating the class, we pass few parameters.
these parameters will be used by the init method usually.
